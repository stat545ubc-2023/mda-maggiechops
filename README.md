# Mini Data Analysis (MDA)
***

This repository contains a mini data analysis assignment completed in the STAT 545A course at UBC. In this project, we will be exploring various datasets with a specific focus on the `vancouver_trees` dataset available through the `datateachr` package in R. Using packages on R such as `dplyr` and `ggplot2`, we will be performing data manipulation and visualization to investigate about how tree planting patterns in Vancouver have changed overtime and across neighborhoods. As of *Oct 6th, 2023*, this repository contains files associated with Milestone 1 of the MDA assignment, while files for Milestone 2 will be added for the final *Oct 25th, 2023* deadline.

## Contents

In this repository, you can find the following files:
* `main.Rmd`: the R Markdown file where bulk of the analysis for this assignment was conducted 
* `main.md`: the output file produced after knitting the .Rmd file
* `main_files`: a folder containing R Markdown-associated files such as figures
* `README.md`: the document you are currently reading that outlines an overview of this project and orients the reader to the structure and contents of this repository

To engage with this repository, simply run the code chunks from top to bottom to reproduce the analysis highlighted in the .Rmd file. This project analyzes datasets available through the [datateachr](https://github.com/UBC-MDS/datateachr) package, as well as [dplyr](https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/) and [ggplot2](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/) packages in R for data manipulation and visualization, respectively.
